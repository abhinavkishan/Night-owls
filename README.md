2) Problem Statement - 

3) Goal - The goal is to create a versatile Discord bot that enables users to:
                - Announce coding contests and create dedicated channels for contests.
                - Provide and solve coding problems sourced from platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces.
                - Support code submission, review, and collaboration within Discord.
                - Offer features such as note uploading, recommendation, GitHub and YouTube search, and code execution.










7) Deployment (if Done)-
        If deploying the bot:
            - Host the bot script on a server or use a hosting service like Heroku or AWS.
            - Set up environment variables for sensitive information (e.g., API keys).
            - Configure the bot to run continuously using tools like pm2 or screen.

8) Applications of Your Idea-
      The Discord bot can be used for:
          - Managing and hosting coding contests within coding communities.
          - Facilitating problem-solving discussions and collaborations.
          - Enhancing engagement and interaction among community members.
          - Providing resources, notes, and external content search capabilities.
          - Enabling code sharing, review, and execution directly within Discord.

9) Further Improvements-
      Future improvements to the bot could include:
          - Implementing more advanced AI capabilities for problem generation or solution evaluation.
          - Integrating with more coding platforms for problem retrieval and contest management.
          - Enhancing code execution features with sandboxing and security measures.
          - Adding user authentication and profile management for personalized experiences.
          - Implementing more interactive and engaging features for coding challenges and quizzes.
          - Optimizing performance and scalability for larger communities and usage patterns.
